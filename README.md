### Sunset notice

We believe there is an opportunity to create a truly outstanding developer experience for deploying to the cloud, however developing this vision requires that we temporarily limit our focus to just one cloud. Gruntwork has hundreds of customers currently using AWS, so we have temporarily suspended our maintenance efforts on this repo. Once we have implemented and validated our vision for the developer experience on the cloud, we look forward to picking this up. In the meantime, you are welcome to use this code in accordance with the open source license, however we will not be responding to GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.

If you wish to be the maintainer for this project, we are open to considering that. Please contact us at support@gruntwork.io.

# Static Assets Modules

This repo contains modules for managing static assets (CSS, JS, images) in GCP.

## Quickstart

If you want to quickly launch a static website using [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/),
you can run the example that is in the root of this repo. Check out the [cloud-storage-static-website example documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/examples/cloud-storage-static-website) for instructions.

## What's in this repo

This repo has the following folder structure:

- [root](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/tree/master): The root folder contains an example of how to launch a static website using [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/). See [cloud-storage-static-website example documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/examples/cloud-storage-static-website) for the documentation.

- [modules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/modules): This folder contains the main implementation code for this Module.

  The primary modules are:

  - [cloud-storage-static-website](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/modules/cloud-storage-static-website):
    The Cloud Storage Static Website module is used to create a [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
    bucket that can be used to host a [static website](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website).

  - [http-load-balancer-website](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/modules/http-load-balancer-website):
    The HTTP Load Balancer Website module is used to create a [HTTP Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/)
    that routes requests to a [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) bucket for static content hosting,
    allowing you to also configure SSL with a custom domain name.

- [examples](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/examples): This folder contains examples of how to use the submodules.

- [test](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/test): Automated tests for the submodules and examples.

## Who maintains this Module?

This Module and its Submodules are maintained by [Gruntwork](http://www.gruntwork.io/). Read the [Gruntwork Philosophy](/GRUNTWORK_PHILOSOPHY.md) document to learn more about how Gruntwork builds production grade infrastructure code. If you are looking for help or commercial support, send an email to
[support@gruntwork.io](mailto:support@gruntwork.io?Subject=Google%20Static%20Assets%20Module).

Gruntwork can help with:

- Setup, customization, and support for this Module.
- Modules and submodules for other types of infrastructure, such as VPCs, Docker clusters, databases, and continuous
  integration.
- Modules and Submodules that meet compliance requirements, such as HIPAA.
- Consulting & Training on GCP, AWS, Terraform, and DevOps.

## How do I contribute to this Module?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.

## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, along
with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-static-assets/releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.

## License
